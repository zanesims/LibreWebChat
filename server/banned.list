# BANNED USERS
# Comments are preceded by "#"
#
# Each line represents a banned user. The format is:
#
# username<TAB>ip_address<TAB>timestamp<TAB>banning_moderator
#
# Only the username is used by the server. The other data is
# for informational purposes only. You can manually ban a user
# by adding their username on a new line in this file. The other
# info following the username is not required (such as the ip address).
# The timestamp generated when a user is banned from the web client is
# representative of the server's local time at the time of the ban.
